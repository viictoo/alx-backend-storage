""" implements a get_page function (prototype: def get_page(url: str) -> str:)
    The core of the function is very simple. It uses the requests module to
    obtain the HTML content of a particular URL and returns it.

    get_page tracks how many times a particular URL was accessed in the key
    "count:{url}" and cache the result with an expiration time of 10 seconds.

    Bonus: implement this use case with decorators.
